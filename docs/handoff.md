# Project handoff

Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first. This is the tracked entry point for resuming
work without the previous conversation. The accepted scope and full milestone
sequence are in [discovery-plan.md](discovery-plan.md).

## Current checkpoint

Current research checkpoint: callback aliases and storage reuse, 2026-10-02,
on branch `cezanne-discovery`, extending `520a44b`. This handoff is committed
with the continuation; check Git history for its commit rather than assuming a
recorded hash is HEAD.
The project remains in **read-only discovery and specification**. No independent
hardware, display or acceleration driver has been implemented or loaded.

Initial target and observed host: PCI `1002:1638`, revision `c9`, reported Ryzen
5 5600GT, macOS 26.4.1 build 25E253. SDK observations used 26.5 on x86_64; do not
silently equate SDK definitions with the runtime's private kernel contract.

Completed work:

- Root operating rules, read-only baseline collector, public Metal inventory,
  parsing/failure tests and independently compared host baseline:
  [README](../README.md), [baseline](hardware-baseline.md).
- Hardware-block map and source-backed IP/firmware selection, with actual host
  block revisions and firmware artifacts still unknown:
  [hardware](cezanne-hardware.md), [target manifest](cezanne-target-manifest.md).
- Metal loader/class construction, path-trust and application-policy gates:
  [admission](metal-admission.md), [requirements](metal-admission-requirements.md).
- Partial IOAccel connection/selector/capacity inventory and configuration,
  allocation address/size/ID, dirty-ring and event/mapping consumer data flow:
  [ABI](ioaccel-abi.md), [shared-memory fields](ioaccel-shared-memory.md).
- Notification callback/refcon registration, partial callback payload consumers,
  two queue retains per submission entry versus one release per callback,
  asynchronous notification-port cancellation and context finalization:
  [lifecycle](ioaccel-lifecycle.md). The earlier automated safety-check stop did
  not recur during ordinary read-only own-child inspection. A loaded-module
  symbol/trampoline search found no explicit unmap symbol; this does not prove
  absence of indirect or kernel cleanup. Earlier claims of guaranteed mapping
  survival and immediate close were corrected, along with selector 5's output
  capacity (8 bytes).
- Metal submission producer fields, separate scheduling/completion block copies,
  their object captures and local transport-failure cleanup:
  [block ownership](ioaccel-block-ownership.md). These provide an ownership graph
  for inspected normal/error paths. Exactly one kernel delivery per distinct
  copy would balance the normal path, but actual message production, callback
  cardinality and reset/reuse remain unverified.
- Completion predicates, reset state, synchronous-debug semaphore prerequisite
  and pooled/unpooled storage cleanup:
  [buffer reuse](ioaccel-buffer-reuse.md). The bounded Metal code scan validates
  only the two producer references to alias slots under supported encodings.
  Completion wait does not establish outer callback/storage drain. Indirect or
  vendor alias access/clearing and cross-thread reuse remain unresolved.

These are observations and static consumer expectations. Independent bundle
admission, a complete negotiated kernel ABI, mapping protection/ownership,
concurrency, GPU execution and desktop presentation remain unverified. An
authorized third-party Metal loading route has not been established. Apple AMD
binaries are observation references and remain excluded from the finished stack.

## Next task: trace generic map/unmap and user-client teardown ownership

Continue read-only graphics-contract work before driver bring-up:

1. Read the [lifecycle](ioaccel-lifecycle.md) and [reuse](ioaccel-buffer-reuse.md)
   studies. Reuse context mapping/finalization and storage release observations;
   no explicit unmap was identified in the earlier inspected wrapper paths.
2. Trace generic XNU map/unmap and user-client teardown in a pinned primary-source
   revision. Account for memory-map ownership, explicit unmap, connection
   close/client death and task exit. Record source version/provenance and which
   private-family callbacks or overrides remain unavailable.
3. Produce an attributed ownership graph, reproducible source locations and
   measurable future cleanup gates. Do not create mappings, open experimental
   clients, exercise teardown or submit work on the working GPU.

Success means generic source-backed ownership/cleanup boundaries and an explicit
limit where private-family or installed-kernel evidence ends. Source revision
agreement with the installed kernel must not be assumed. This does not verify
mapping reclamation, callback cancellation, cross-thread reuse or GPU completion
on this host. Alias accesses through vendor/indirect paths and complete commit
dispatch remain separate open interfaces.

Parallel areas of future investigation, when relevant: primary vendor admission
contracts, offline firmware provenance/header validation and shader target
qualification. Keep those separate from a focused lifecycle batch. Driver
installation/loading, PCI ownership, register writes or GPU takeover require an
explicitly available experimental environment and recovery path; this handoff
does not authorize them.

## Evidence and reproduction

Saved evidence on this workspace is ignored and contains sensitive/raw details:

| Local location | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `out/baseline-verified-20261002/report.json` | Normalized baseline and per-query evidence references |
| `out/independent-20261002/` | Independent PCI/display/Metal comparisons |
| `out/metal-abi-study/` | Loader/trust/connection/queue/finalizer captures and source indexes |
| `out/metal-abi-verified/` | Verified public-child, SDK-layout and root-inspection examples |
| `out/metal-contract-detail/` | Field/ring/mapping and policy captures, source digests and `experiment-index.json` |
| `out/ioaccel-lifecycle-detail/` | Queue/callback/notification/context disassembly, module symbols, primary sources, host queries and verification index |
| `out/ioaccel-block-ownership/` | Metal block producers/callers, descriptor/helper reads, completion/deallocation, preserved lookup failures, host queries, primary references and verification index |
| `out/ioaccel-buffer-reuse/` | Reset/wait/storage-pool disassembly, bounded alias scan, controlled bound rejection, SDK/primary contracts, host queries and verification index |
| `out/discovery-progress.md` | Local execution ledger; supplementary to this tracked handoff |

A fresh clone will not contain `out/`. Tracked documents supply reproduction
instructions; the public metadata child's source is in
[metal-loader-study.md](metal-loader-study.md), and the debugger stopping/capture
procedure is in [metal-admission.md](metal-admission.md). Build artifacts and new
captures belong in a new ignored output directory. Record OS/build, architecture,
PCI/revision, command, UTC time, stdout/stderr and exit status. Preserve failures,
stop at denied inspection and avoid carrying addresses across launches. Normal
public enumeration may initialize the existing stack internally; that is not
manual private invocation or independent-driver proof.

## Verification record and commands

The reuse continuation ran all 13 existing tests successfully, rebuilt the
unchanged public metadata child and reproduced 19 documented LLDB read commands
(18 disassemblies and the bounded alias reader). The reader validates the two
producer references within 2,144,545 bytes of Metal code. A controlled one-byte
bound rejects the scan with an assertion before the bulk section read, although
LLDB exits 0; diagnostics are checked separately. Source/header and borrowed
evidence digests, 103 relative links and whitespace were checked. Raw captures
retain a function-name lookup failure for ivar data, an enumeration locale warning
and web-reader source failures; disassembly-only reproduction and official source
captures succeeded. These checks verify evidence collection and document
consistency, not GPU functionality. Detailed verification records remain in the
local execution ledger and experiment index. Independent review found no
Critical or Important issues; its wording correction was verified, with no
Minor issues remaining. Verify new changes before claiming they pass.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
git diff --check
git status --short
```

For documentation-only changes, check links, attribution and factual claims
against evidence. For probe/tool changes, use meaningful failure-path tests and
reproduce the affected read-only commands. Verify and commit small focused
batches with the configured author and no agent co-author trailers. Keep raw
captures, machine identifiers and runtime addresses untracked. Update this file
as the next task and evidence limits change.
